'''
Given an array of n integers nums, a 132 pattern is a subsequence of three integers nums[i], nums[j] and nums[k] such that i < j < k and nums[i] < nums[k] < nums[j].

Return true if there is a 132 pattern in nums, otherwise, return false.

Follow up: The O(n^2) is trivial, could you come up with the O(n logn) or the O(n) solution?

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: false
Explanation: There is no 132 pattern in the sequence.
Hint: Stack

            return True

            return False
